| asset_guid                    | OK                 | This is the unique GUID generated for each asset and is generated before incorporation into the storage system. Parts of the string are defined based on things such as the workstation and institution, the other parts are randomly generated. This is to enable a unique name for each asset. It is mandatory for our funding that we also have persistent identifiers for each asset (ideally resolvable as well). So we imagined an easy way to do this would be to incorporate the guid into a persistent identifier that can be clicked on to resolve (see asset_pid).                     | String                                                                       | yes                                                                       |                                                                                                                                         |                                                                   |

Thus one asset is linked to multiple specimens. On one hand it is data that needs to carried through to Specify (multispecimen objects are modelled using containers in Specify); however, we can imagine needing to search on this in the storage registry to check the pipeline has worked as it should for these specimens and assets. But also, how many multispecimen objects we have dealt with is an important statistic for measuring and helping refine workflows. | boolean                                                                      | no - generated value. true if more than one specimen barcode is provided. | [2025-14-02 Thomas] A causes this value not to be set even if asset is connected to more than one specimen                              |                                                                   |
