Specimens are created together with assets and they inherit the institution and collection from the asset it was created
with. If another asset is created with a specimen containing the same information it will be linked to the previously
created specimen.

| barcode                                 | This refers to a physical barcode on the specimen consisting of 8 digits. It is part of an ID unique to that specimen and consisting of: An institution acronym, a collection acronym, and the barcode. We can have one specimen barcode related to multiple assets and in sme cases one asset with multiple specimen barcodes (an example of the later is a multispecimen herbarium sheet). | String          | yes                              |                                    |
