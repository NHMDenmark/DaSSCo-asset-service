Specimens are created together with assets and they inherit the institution and collection from the asset it was created with. If another asset is created with a specimen containing the same information it will be linked to the previously created specimen.

| barcode                 | This refers to a physical barcode on the specimen consisting of 8 digits. It is part of an ID unique to that specimen and consisting of: An institution acronym, a collection acronym, and the barcode. We can have one specimen barcode related to multiple assets and in sme cases one asset with multiple specimen barcodes (an example of the later is a multispecimen herbarium sheet). | String   | yes                              |       |
| preparation_type        | This relates to the way the specimen has been prepared (e.g., a pinned insect or mounted on a slide). Whilst this is specimen data, it is also fundamental to how we are keeping track of the project - as the different ways a specimen is prepared will affect our planning, our pipelines, reporting etc. Hence, incorporating this field into the registry makes sense.                  | String   | no                               |       |
| specimen_pid            | We need a system to uniquely resolve assets. We don't currently have a system in place for this. We need to develop this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | String   |                                  |       |
