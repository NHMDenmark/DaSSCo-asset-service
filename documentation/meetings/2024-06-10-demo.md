# Demo Meeting - 2024-06-10

## WP1

### Asset Service - Bug Fixes
- Fixed getAssetStatus, it now returns the intended status code.

### FileProxy - Bug Fixes
- More stable ERDA connection
  - But we're attempting to increase the connection pool from 3 to 8 in the future
- Moved and change the mounted volume, it was using a volume with 20 GB instead of the 100 GB mount on the server.
  - This caused an error, where it didn't create the share folder.

### Documentation
- Swagger API is now up-to-date with Confluence, and will be the main Documentation for the REST API going forth.
- We've added a dropdown to show on the Swagger Docs, so you can now see both the AssetService and FileProxy REST API here

### Tests
- NorthTech has created a test suite with integration tests, but is currently awaiting a new deployment to the DaSSCo Servers. (Can't currently connect to the servers at all)
- Increase the code coverage of the project in general, both AssetService and FileProxy
